        <p style="color: darkgreen;"><b>The Hulk is a big, strong, and green superhero! He's actually <span
                    style="color: darkgray;"> <br>Dr. Bruce Banner,</span> but when he gets angry or upset, he turns
                into the Hulk.<br>
                The Hulk is super strong and can lift really heavy things, like cars and even buildings! He's almost
                invincible, which means he's really hard to hurt.<br>
                But sometimes, the Hulk gets a little out of control and can cause a lot of damage.
